# Functions

## Statements and Expressions

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression.

_Statements_ are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.

_Expressions_ evaluate to a resulting value.

```rust
fn main() {
  let y = {
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
  };
}
```

This is expression:

```rust
{
  let x = 3;
  x + 1
}
```

## Functions with Return Values

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
  5
}

fn main() {
  let x = five();
}
```

There are no function calls, macros, or even `let` statements in the `five` function--just the number 5 by itself.
