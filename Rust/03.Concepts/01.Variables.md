# Variables and Mutability

## Constants

immutable variables vs. constants:

- don't allowed to use `mut` with constants
- declare constants must be annotated the type of the value
- constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope
- constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime

```rust
const MAX_VALUE: i32 = 100;
let x = 50;
const MIN_VALUE: i32 = x; // Error: initializer is not a constant expression
```

attention: can use a `match` expression to assign a value to constants

```rust
const MAX_VALUE: i32 = 100;

const MIN_VALUE: i32 = match MAX_VALUE {
  0 => 10,
  50 => 20,
  100 => 30,
  _ => 0,
};
```
