# Defining and Instantiating Structs

```rust
struct User {
  active: bool,
  username: String,
  email: String,
  sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

We create an _instance_ fo that struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields. To get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation.

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut user1 = User {
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
  }

  let username1 = user1.username;

  user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@exmaple.com");
}
```

## Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
  let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
  let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```

## Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields

You can also define structs that don't have any fields! These are called _unit-like structs_ because they behave similarly to `()`.

Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don't have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
  let subject = AlwayEqual;
}
```
