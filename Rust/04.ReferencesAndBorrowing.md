# References and Borrowing

A _reference_ is like a pointer in that it's an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid of a particular type for the life of that reference.

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello");

  let len = calculate_length(&s1);

  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
  s.len()
} // Here, s goes out of scope. But because it does not have ownership of what it refers to, it is not dropped.
```

We call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_.

## Mutable Reference

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut s = String::from("hello");

  change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_thing: &mut String) {
  some_thing.push_str(", world");
}
```

Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to value, you can have no other references to that value. This code that attempts to create two mutable references to `s` will fail:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;

println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
```

Here's the error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
 --> src/main.rs:5:14
  |
4 |     let r1 = &mut s;
  |              ------ first mutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &mut s;
  |              ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
6 |
7 |     println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
  |                        -- first borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0499`.
error: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error
```

As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not simultaneous ones:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
}
```

Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references. This code result in a error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
}
```

Here's the error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:6:14
  |
4 |     let r1 = &s; // no problem
  |              -- immutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &s; // no problem
6 |     let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
  |              ^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 |
8 |     println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
  |                                -- immutable borrow later used here

Dangling References

In languages with pointers, it's easy to erroneously create a _dangling pointer_ -- a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else -- by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory.

In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references will never be dangling references: if you have a reference to some data, the compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

```rust
fn main() {
  let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}

fn dangle() -> &String {
  let s = String::from("hello");

  &s
}
```

Here's the error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/main.rs:5:16
