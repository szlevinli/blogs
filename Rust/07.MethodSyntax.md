# Method Syntax

_Methods_ are similar to functions.

## Defining Methods

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
    self.width * self.height
  }
}

fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
  };

  println!(
    "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
    rect1.area()
  );
}
```

## Associated Function and Constructor

All functions defined within an `impl` block are called _associated functions_ because they're associated with the type named after the `impl`.

Associated functions that aren't methods are often used for constructor that will return a new instance of the struct.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
    Self {
      width: size,
      height: size,
    }
  }
}

let sq = Rectangle::square(3);
```

## Multiple `impl` Blocks

Each struct is allowed to have multiple `impl` blocks.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
    self.with * self.height
  }
}

impl Rectangle {
  fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
    self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
  }
}
```
