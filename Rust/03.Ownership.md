# What is Ownership?

_Ownership_ is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory.

All programs have to manage the way they use a computer's memory while running.

- garbage collection
- explicitly allocate and free the memory
- a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks.

## Ownership Rules

- Each value in Rust has an _owner_.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

## Variable Scope

In other words, there are two important points in time here:

- When variable comes into _scope_, it is valid.
- It remains valid until it goes out of _scope_.

## The `String` Type

We want to look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to clean up that data, and the `String` type is a great example.

Why can `String` be mutated but literals cannot? The difference is how these two types deal with memory.

## Memory and Allocation

When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called `drop`, and it's where the author of `String` can put the code to return the memory. Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing curly brackets.

### Ways Variables and Data Interact: Move

Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
```

This is indeed what is happening, because integers are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two `5` values are pushed onto the stack.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to.

Because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of calling it a shallow copy, it's known as _move_.

### Ways Variables and Date interact: Clone

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
```

### Stack-Only Data: Copy

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
```

But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don't have a call to `clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn't moved into `y`.

The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick to make.

## Ownership and Function

```rust
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("hello"); // s comes into scop

  takes_ownership(s);            // s's value moves into the function...
                                 // ... and so is no longer valid here

  let x = 5;                     // x comes into scope

  makes_copy(x);                 // x would move into the function,
                                // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                // use x afterward
} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_thing comes into scope
  println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
  println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens
```

## Return Values and Scope

Returning values can also transfer ownership.

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = gives_ownership();        // gives_ownership moves its return value into s1

  let s2 = String::from("hello");    // s2 comes into scope

  let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2); // s2 is moved into
                                     // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                     // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {           // gives_ownership will move its
                                           // return value into the function
                                           // that calls it

  let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

  some_string                              // some_string is returned and move out to the calling
                                           // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope
  a_string // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```
