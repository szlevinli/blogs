# Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store values of the same type.

## Creating a New Vector

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

Use `vec!` macro

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

## Updating a Vector

```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
```

## Reading Elements of Vectors

There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: via indexing or using the `get` method.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2];
println("The third element is {}", third);

let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
match third {
  Some(third) => println!("The third element is {}", third),
  None => println!("There is no third element.");
}
```

About ownership and borrowing.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = &v[0];

    v.push(6);

    println!("The first element is: {}", first);
}
```

Compiling this code will result in this error:

```bash
$ cargo run
