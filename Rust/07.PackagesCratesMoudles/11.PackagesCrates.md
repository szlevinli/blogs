# Packages and Crates

A _crate_ is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers as a time.

A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.

The _crate root_ is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root modules of your crate.

A _package_ is a bundle of one or more crates that providers a set of functionality. A package contains a _Cargo.toml_ file that describe how to build those crate.

A package can contain as many binary crates as you like, but at most only one library crate.

A package must contain at least one crate, whether that's a library or binary crate.

Cargo follows a convention thar _src/main.rs_ is the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package.

Cargo knows thar if the package directory contains _src/lib.rs_, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the package, and _src/lib.rs_ is its crate root.

Here, we have a package that only contains _src/main.rs_, meaning it only contains a binary crate named `my-project`. If a package contains _src/main.rs_ adn _src/lib.rs_, it has two crates: a binary and a library, both with the same name as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in the _src/bin_ directory: each file will be a separate binary crate.
