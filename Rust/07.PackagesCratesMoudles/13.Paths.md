# Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same way we use a path when navigating a filesystem.

A path can take two forms:

- An _absolute path_ is the full path starting from a crate root; for code from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for code from the current crate, it starts with the literal `crate`.
- A _relative path_ from the current module and use `self, super`, or an identifier in the current module.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

## Starting Relative Paths with `super`

We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than the current or the crate root, by using `super` at the start of the path. This is like starting a filesystem path with the `..` syntax.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
  fn fix_incorrect_order() {
    cook_order();
    super::deliver_order();
  }

  fn cook_order() {}
}
```

## Making Structs and Enums Public

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod back_of_house {
  pub struct Breakfast {
    pub toast: String,
    seasonal_fruit: String,
  }

  impl Breakfast {
    pub fn summer(toast: &str) -> Breakfast {
      Breakfast {
        toast: String::from(toast),
        seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
      }
    }
  }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
  // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast
  let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
  // Change our mind about what bread we'd like
  meal.toast = String::from("Wheat");
  println!("I'd like {} toast please", meal.toast);

  // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
  // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal
  // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries");

}
```

In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public. We only need the `pub` before the `enum` keyword.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
mod back_of_house {
  pub enum Appetizer {
    Soup,
    Salad,
  }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
  let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
  let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}
```
