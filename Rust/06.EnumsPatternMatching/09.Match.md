# The `match` Control Flow Construct

```rust
enum Coin {
  Penny,
  Nickel,
  Dime,
  Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel ==> 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter => 25,
  }
}
```

## Patterns that Bind to Values

Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum UsState {
  Alabama,
  Alaska,
}

enum Coin {
  Penny,
  Nickel,
  Dime,
  Quarter(UsState),
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel ==> 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter(state) => {
      println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
      25
    },
  }
}
```

## Matching with `Option<T>`

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Options<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
  match x {
    None => None,
    Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
  }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None);
```

## Matches are Exhaustive

Matches in Rust are _exhaustive_: we must exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid.

## Catch-all Patterns and the `_` Placeholder

Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular values, but for all other values take on default action.
