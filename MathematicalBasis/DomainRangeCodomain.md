# Domain, Range and Codomain

## Function

A function **_relates_** an input to an output.

## Domain, Codomain and Range

There are special names for **what can go into**, and **what can come out** of a function:

- What can go **into** a function is called the **Domain**
- What **may possibly come out** of a function is called the **Codomain**
- What **actually comes out** of a function is called the **Range**

The domain is an essential part of the function.

## Does Every Function Have a Domain?

Yes, but in simpler mathematics we never notice this, because the domain is **_assumed_**:

- Usually it is assumed to be something like "all numbers that will work".
- Or if we are studying whole numbers, the domain is assumed to be whole numbers,

## Codomain vs. Range

The Codomain and Range are both on the output side, but are subtly different.

The Codomain is the set of values that could **possibly** come out. The Codomain is actually **part of the definition** of the function.

And The Range is the set of values that **actually do** come out. The Range is a subset of the Codomain.

**Why both?** Well, sometimes we don't know the **_exact_** range (because the function may be complicated or not fully known), but we know the set it **_lies in_** (such as integers or reals). So we define the codomain and continue on.

## The Importance of Codomain

Let me ask you a question: Is **_square root_** a function?

If we say the codomain (the possible outputs) is **the set of real numbers**, then square root is **not a function!**

The reason is that there could be two answers for on input, for example **f(9) = 3 or -3**
