# Central Limit theorem

The samples statistic sample mean $\bar{X}$ exhibits a unique behavior - regardless of the population distribution (uniform, exponential, other), in the limit $n \to \infty$ ($n$ tends to infinity, where $n$ is the sample size), the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ tends to nomarl distribution. The _rate_ at which the sampling distribution approaches normal distribution depends on the population distribution. Now, if the population itself is normally distributed, the $\bar{X}$ is normally distributed for _any_ sample size. This is the essence of what is called Central Limit theorem.

> _在统计样本均值 $\bar{X}$ 时会呈现一种独特的行为 - 无论全量分布呈什么形式 (正态分布, 幂分布, 等), 在样本数量 $n$ 趋向于无穷大时, $\bar{X}$ 的样本分布趋向于正态分布. 样本分布趋向于正态分布的速度依赖于全量分布形式. 现在, 如果说全量呈正态分布, 那么 $\bar{X}$ 在任何样本数量的情况下都呈正态分布形式. 这就是中心极限理论的基础或本质._

KEY TAKEAWAYS

- The central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample mean approximates a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the population's distribution.
- Sample sizes equal to or greater than 30 are often considered sufficient of the CLT to hold.
- A key aspect of CLT is that the average of the sample mean and standard deviations will equal the population mean and standard deviation.
- A sufficiently large sample size can predict the characteristics of a population more accurately.
