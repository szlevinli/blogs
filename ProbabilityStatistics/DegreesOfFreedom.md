# Degrees of Freedom

The degrees of freedom (DF) in statistics indicate the number of independent values that can vary in an analysis without breaking any constrains.

## Definition of Degrees of Freedom

Degrees of freedom are the number of independent values that a statistical analysis can estimate. You can also think of it as the number of values that are free to vary as you estimate parameters.

The degrees of freedom equals your sample size minus the number of parameters you need to calculate during an analysis.

## Independent Information and Constraints on Values

Suppose we collect the random sample of observations shown below. Now, imagine we know the mean, bu we don't know the value of an observation - the X in the table below.

| Values |
| -----: |
|      6 |
|      8 |
|      5 |
|      9 |
|      6 |
|      8 |
|      4 |
|     11 |
|      7 |
|      X |

The mean is 6.9, and it is based on 10 values. So, we know that the values must sum t0 69 base on the equation for the mean.

Using simple algebra $64 + X = 69$, we know that $X$ must equal 5.
