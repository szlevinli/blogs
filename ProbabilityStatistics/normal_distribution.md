# Normal Distribution

> Source: [maths is fun - Normal Distribution](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html)

The **Normal Distribution** has:

- mean = median = mode
- symmetry about the center
- 50% of values less than the mean and 50% greater than the mean

## Standard Deviations

- **68%** of values are within **1 standard deviation** of the mean
- **95%** of values are within **2 standard deviations** of the mean
- **99.7%** of values are within **3 standard deviations** of the mean

## Standard Scores

So to convert a value to Standard Score ("z-score"):

- first subtract the mean,
- the divide by the Standard Deviation

A Normal Distribution -- Standardize --> The Standard Normal Distribution.

The **z-score formula**:

$$
z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
$$
