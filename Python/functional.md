# Functional programme

## Libraries

### PyToolz

> Home Page: [Toolz](https://toolz.readthedocs.io/)

Toolz provides a set of utility functions for iterators, functions, and dictionaries. These functions interoperate well and form the building blocks of common data analytic operations. They extend the standard libraries *itertools* and *functools* and borrow heavily from the standard libraries or contemporary functional languages.

Toolz provides a suite of functions which have the following functional virtues:

- **Composable:** They interoperate due to their use of core data structures.
- **Pure:** They don't change their inputs or rely on external state.
- **Lazy:** They don't run until absolutely necessary, allowing them to support large streaming data sets.

### OSlash

> Home Page: [OSlash](https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash)

OSlash is a library for playing with function programming in Python 3.8+. It's an attempt to re-implement some of the code from [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) in Pythons 3.8. OSlash unifies functional and object oriented paradigms by grouping related function with classes. Objects are however never used for storing values or mutable data, and data only lives within function closures.

### Fn.py

> Home Page: [Fn.py](https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py)

`Fn.py` library provides you with missing "batteries" to get maximum from functional approach even in mostly-imperative program.
